Based on the provided patient information and the associated fundus image, does the patient has Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)?

Respond with **yes** if the patient has any level of diabetic retinopathy (ICDR score ≥ 1), or **no** if the score is 0. 
According to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) classification, an eye is considered ICDR 0 when no retinal abnormalities related to diabetic retinopathy are present. ICDR ≥1 indicates the presence of any diabetic retinopathy, defined by the observation of one or more characteristic lesions such as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard exudates,  venous beading, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), neovascularization, or vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage. Additionally, the presence of panretinal (panphotocoagulation) laser scars is considered evidence of treated proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
